For Fabric

Minecraft caps your gear's potential, preventing you from making that totally not overpowered Sharpness X sword.

This mod fixes that, so you can waste all of your experience on that sword. Oh, and so you actually have something to do in the deep late-game.

NOTE: This mod is only hosted on Modrinth and Github. Any other distributions of this mod are untrustworthy, even if the website itself is not malicious. stopmodreposts.com attempts to prevent this.
